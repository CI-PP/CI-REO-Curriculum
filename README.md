### **SCIPE Cyberinfrastructure Pacific Professionals (CI-PP): Cyberinfrastructure \- Research Education Opportunity Curriculum**

This research experience provides an overview of modern research cyberinfrastructure (CI) and equips students with the foundational knowledge and practical skills to utilize these powerful tools. Students will explore how CI enables cutting-edge research across a variety of scientific domains and will work with a mentor on a hands-on project related to supporting research with cyberinfrastructure resources or methods.
